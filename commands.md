ğŸ”¸ cp /copied_item /target    copies a filed or directory to a target directory. If your copying a directory use cp -rf . .
ğŸ”¸ pwd                        shows the absolute path of where you are (present working directory)
ğŸ”¸ chmod ### file             how you give or remove access to files. first digit is you, second is group and last is all users 
(read=4,write=2,execute=1. ex: use 777 for full access to everyone)
ğŸ”¸ diff /file /file           outputs the lines that do not match between the two files
ğŸ”¸ rm file                    remove command lets you remove a file. Removing a directory requires -rf (ex: rm -rf dir)
ğŸ”¸ mkdir directoryname        makes a directory with the name specified
ğŸ”¸ touch filename             makes a file with the name specified
ğŸ”¸ mv file file               lets you move a file somewhere else and is also used to rename files
ğŸ”¸ cat file                   displays the text of a file
ğŸ”¸ man "command"              displays the manual for the command specified. Useful to find options for the command quickly
ğŸ”¸ history                    shows the commands you've entered

ğŸ”¸ |                          this symbol is called "pipe" and is used to feed output of one command into another command without 
storing it into a variable (ex: "ls -s | head -5" takes the list of files ordered by size from ls and prints the top 5 of them)

```

ğŸ”¸ ls -i          list file's inode index number
ğŸ”¸ ls -l          list with long format - show permissions
ğŸ”¸ ls -la         list long format including hidden files
ğŸ”¸ ls -lh         list long format with readable file size

```
## grep
**grep commands** ``` grep [options] pattern [files] ```

ğŸ”¸ grep -h        Display the matched lines, but do not display the filenames
ğŸ”¸ grep -i        Ignores, case for matching
ğŸ”¸ grep -l        Displays list of a filenames only
ğŸ”¸ grep -n        Display the matched lines and their line numbers.
ğŸ”¸ grep -v        This prints out all the lines that do not matches the pattern
ğŸ”¸ grep -e exp    Specifies expression with this option. Can use multiple times
ğŸ”¸ grep -f file   Takes patterns from file, one per line
ğŸ”¸ grep -E        Treats pattern as an extended regular expression (ERE)
ğŸ”¸ grep -w        Match whole word      
```
## sed
**sed commands** ``` sed [option] 'command' [input-file] ```

ğŸ”¸ sed 's/Sonday/Sunday/' weekday.txt
ğŸ”¸ sed -i         When option, edit source file directly. Also used to ignore case when flag
ğŸ”¸ sed -g         Edit every occurence
ğŸ”¸ ^              Acts like a special character and matches at the beginning of the regular exp
ğŸ”¸ $              Acts like a special character and matches at the end of the regular exp

ğŸ”¸ *              Matches the sequence of zero or more instances of the previous character
ğŸ”¸ sed 's/Linux/Unix/'  linuxteck.txt (first occurence in each line)
ğŸ”¸ sed 's/Linux/Unix/2' linuxteck.txt (Second occurence in each line)
```
## sort
**sort commands** ``` sort [OPTION]... [FILE]... ```
```
ğŸ”¸ sort -b        Remove all whitespace
ğŸ”¸ sort -d        Consider only blanks and alphanumeric characters
ğŸ”¸ sort -f        Fold lower case to upper case characters
ğŸ”¸ sort -g        Compare according to general numerical value
ğŸ”¸ sort -i        Consider only printable characters
ğŸ”¸ sort -n        Compare according to string numerical value
```
## head/tail
**head commands** ``` head [OPTION]... [FILE]... ```
```
ğŸ”¸ head -n #      Print number of lines from top down
ğŸ”¸ tail -#        prints last # of elements (lines/files)
```
